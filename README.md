# Data Transmission Using LED Ligh 

## INTRODUCTION

Transfer data from one place to another is one of the most important day-to-day activities. The current wireless networks that connect us to the internet are very slow when multiple devices are connected. As the number of devices that access the internet increases, the fixed bandwidth available makes it more and more difficult to enjoy high data rates and connect to a secure network. Nowadays, Everyone is interested in using his mobile phone, laptop to communicate with other people through Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) systems, and this technology, Wi-Fi, is widely used in all public areas like home, cafes, hotels and airports by people, also the time usage of wireless systems is increasing exponentially every year; but the capacity is going down, due to the limitation of Radio Frequency (RF) resources, so we are going to suffer from severe problem. 

This project Data Transmission Using Visible Light is new technology is known as Light–Fidelity (Li-Fi). It is a short range wireless communication system based on light illumination from LED and it is the future of communication technology. 

### COMPONENT NEED FOR DATA TRANSMISSION USING LED LIGHT :
- Solar Panel
- Aux Cable
- LED Light
- 9V Battery
- Speaker
- 220 ohm Resistor

## WHAT IS DATA TRANSMISSION USING LED LIGHT….??? 
- It is the medium of data transfer by using Li-Fi.
- Li-Fi – “LIGHT FIDEALITY” is transmission of data through illumination, i.e. sending data through a LED light bulb that varies in intensity faster than human eye can follow.
- Li-Fi is a light based Wi-Fi it uses light instead of radio waves to transmit information.
